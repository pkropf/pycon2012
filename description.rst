Description
-----------

Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. Python is our favorate programming language that allows you to integrate systems more effectively. Learn how to use Python to communicate with an Arduino and interact with sensors, solenoids and motors.

Abstract
--------

This talk with introduce the Arduino microcontroller and show how to interact with it using Python. With a serial line command protocol, Python code can easily turn on digital I/O pins to turn on LEDs, change the pulse width modulation (PWM) to alter brightness or move a stepper motor. Examples will be shown of a small robot that has a pair of 2 axis gimbles that serve as eyes and of controlling fire effect sequencing.
